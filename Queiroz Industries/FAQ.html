	<h3>FAQ 1: How do I know if the product fits?</h3>
	<p>We often get this question on QueirozIndustries.com. When shopping online, you need to know your measurements. We all know that sizes vary depending on the brand or country (e.g. European sizes vs American sizes). We recommend you take a measuring tape and take note of your bust, waist, hips and inseam. You can have your local tailor do it for you if you want.Also, on QueirozIndustries.com, we have a sizing guide that will help you determine how to convert your size. Note that US sizes are generally larger than European or Asian sizes. For example, a US ‘M’ is usually a European ‘L’.On QueirozIndustries, we aim to get clothes that fit easily. But do check the material and cut of the clothes you are buying. If it is tight fitting, you would be safer to buy one size larger (for example, if you usually wear an ‘M’, buy an ‘L’) and have it re-sized at your local tailor.We also have our customer service representatives who will help you with your purchase via email, on the phone or on social media. So do not be shy to talk with customer service.</p>
	
	<h3>FAQ 2: Is it safe to shop online?</h3>
	<p>This is an important question and our priority at QueirozIndustries.com is to ensure the privacy of our customers and safety of payment.First, we highly recommend you have a strong password for your shopping website.On QueirozIndustries.com, we offer various ways of payment including Cash on Delivery (COD), PayPal & Credit Cards and have strategic partnerships with well-known banks in the region. We also protect our website with ‘Norton Secured’. When shopping online, make sure that the website has an SSL (secure sockets layer) encryption installed which is represented by an icon of a locked padlock.Another tip is to have one credit card for your online purchases. This helps you track your purchases and God forbid something wrong happens, you can cancel that credit card. Some banks are also offering an ‘Internet Credit Card’ that has a capped amount.</p>
	
	<h3>FAQ3: Are the brands authentic?</h3>
	<p>Unfortunately in our region, we have heard that there are some websites that do not offer authentic brands. On QueirozIndustries.com, we ensure that our brands are authentic and sourced from trust-worthy suppliers.If you are buying from websites that you are not familiar with, research the products they offer. Also, if the price for a well-known brand is ‘too good to be true’ then talk to the website and do exercise caution.Also, read the website’s return and exchange policies before making a purchase and talk to customer service if you are not satisfied with your purchase.Finally, get to know the website you are buying from. For example, you can make a small purchase to test the products they sell and then when you are satisfied with their products and their service, then make bigger purchases.</p>
	
	<h3>FAQ 4: How can I save when shopping online? </h3>
	<p>One of the benefits of shopping online is that you are able to find products at lower prices due to the economics of e-commerce.We recommend you sign-up to the newsletter of your favorite online shopping websites, as they will give you a heads-up of any sale they are having. At QueirozIndustries, we send our members a newsletter to keep them up to date with new products and sales.Also, follow the websites on social media as many will inform you of savings and offers through those channels.

We know that shopping online is fun and it should be! Check out QueirozIndustries.com for the latest trends in affordable fashion, and do let us know if you have any other questions. Until the next time, happy shopping!</p>
